# Introduction

ClassChat is an education based web application designed around allowing students to ask and answer questions anonymously. One key issue on the topic is that many people will not ask questions in front of other students. Students will go as far as not asking questions and never knowing the answer. Most of the time teachers will prefer a lively class but most students will not participate because they are shy, have anxiety, or just because they are with others (Ray, K et. al, 2014). Most students will not be able to learn if they do not ask questions. Questions are a big part of learning. With our project, we hope to be able to give students a way in which they can ask questions without worrying about their anxiety and to make it enjoyable in the process.
